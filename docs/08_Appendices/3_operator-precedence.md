# Operator Precedence

The precedence order of the operators covered in these notes is important in the evaluation of compound expressions. A compound expression consists of several sub-expressions. Different orders of evaluation are possible in such expressions. That is, the results of evaluating the entire compound expression depend on the order of evaluating its sub-expressions.

To ensure unique evaluation of all compound expressions, C++ defines rules of precedence on the operators in a compound expression. This order is from top to bottom in the table shown below. The operators associate operands in each sub-expression as noted in the right column, mostly from left to right.

| Operator | Associate From |
| :---: | :---: |
| `::` | Left to right |
| `[ ]` `.` `->` `++` (postfix) `--` (postfix) | Left to right |
| `++` (prefix) `--` (prefix) `+` `-` `&` `!` (all unary) `new` `new[]` `delete` `delete[]` `(type)`, `type()` | Right to left |
| `.*` `->*` | Left to right |
| `*` `/` `%` | Left to right |
| `+` `-` | Left to right |
| `>>` `<<` | left to right |
| `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | Left to right |
| `==` `!=` | Left to right |
| `&&` | Left to right |
| `||` | Left to right |
| `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` | Right to left |
| `?:` | Left to right |
| `,` | Left to right |

The scope resolution operator `::` has the highest precedence. An expression containing this operator is always evaluated first.

We can change the order of evaluation within a compound expression by enclosing a sub-expression in parentheses. That is, we use `(sub-expression)` to evaluate `sub-expression` before applying the rules of precedence to the entire expression. 

For example,
 ` 2 + 3  * 5` evaluates to `2 + 15` which evaluates to `17`.
 `(2 + 3) * 5` evaluates to `5 * 5 ` which evaluates to `25`.
